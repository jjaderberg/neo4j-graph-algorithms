= Community detection: Triangle Counting / Clustering Coefficient

Triangle counting is a community detection graph algorithm which is used to determine the number of triangles passing through each node in the graph. A node is part of a triangle when it has two linked nodes with an relationship between. 
The triangle is a three-node subgraph, where every two nodes are connected.[1] 


== History, Explanation

Counting the number of triangles in a graph is a fundamental problem with various applications. 
The problem has been studied before from a theoretic point of view. 
It can be seen as a special case of counting given length cycles. 
On the other hand, counting triangles is a basic issue in network analysis. 
Due to the increasing interest in analyzing large networks like the Internet, the WWW or social networks, the computation of network indices based on counting triangles has become an often used tool in network analysis. 
For example, the so-called clustering coefficient is frequently quoted as an important index for measuring the concentration of clusters in graphs respectively its tendency to decompose into communities. 
The local clustering coefficient of a node v is defined as the likeliness that two neighbors u and w of v are also connected, while the clustering coefficient of a graph is just the normalized sum of the clustering coefficient of its nodes. 
Accordingly, its computation involves counting the number of triangles. 
Similarly the transitivity coefficient of a graph, which is just three times the number of triangles divided by the number of triples (paths of length two) in the graph is sometimes considered.[2] 

== When to use it / use-cases

Finding patterns in large scale graphs, with millions and billions of edges is attracting increasing interest, with numerous applications in computer network security (intrusion detection, spamming), in web applications (community detection, blog analysis) in social networks (facebook, linkedin, for link prediction), and many more. 
One of the operations of interest in such a setting is the estimation of the clustering coefficient and the transitivity ratio, which effectively translates to the number of triangles in the graph, or the number of triangles that a node participates in.
It is known that in social networks there is a higher than-random number of triangles. 
The reason is that friends of friends are typically friends themselves.
Thus, the number of triangles can help us spot abnormal graphs and abnormal nodes https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/110b/55a017f52abfedca220036ea129d84b7cadc.pdf[[5\]].
More-than-expected number of triangles also appear in biological networks,such as protein-protein interaction networks https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/1471-2105-6-270?site=bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com[[7\]].
A very recent work https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/110b/55a017f52abfedca220036ea129d84b7cadc.pdf[[5\]] shows that the distribution of the local number of triangles can be used to create successful spam filters and also provide useful features to assess content quality in social networks. 
In http://www.pnas.org/content/99/9/5825.full.pdf[[6\]] the distribution of triangles is used to uncover hidden thematic structure in the World Wide Web. 
Therefore, counting triangles is a significant problem in graph mining, with several important applications.[3]

== Example Usage

In graph theory, a clustering coefficient is a measure of the degree to which nodes in a graph tend to cluster together.
Evidence suggests that in most real-world networks, and in particular social networks, nodes tend to create tightly knit groups characterised by a relatively high density of ties; this likelihood tends to be greater than the average probability of a tie randomly established between two nodes.[4] 

We check if this holds true for Yelp's social network of friends.

[source,cypher]
----
include::scripts/triangle-count.cypher[tag=triangle-write-yelp]
----

Average clustering coefficient is 0.0523, which is really low for a social network. 
This indicates that groups of friends are not tightly knit together, but rather sparse.
We can assume that users are not on Yelp for finding and creating friends, like for example Facebook, but rather something else, like finding good restaurant recommendations.

   
Local triangle count and clustering coefficient of nodes can be used as features in finding influencers in social networks.

== Cypher loading

If label and relationship-type are not selective enough to describe your subgraph to run the algorithm on, you can use Cypher statements to load or project subsets of your graph.
Can be also used to run algorithms on a virtual graph.
Set `graph:'cypher'` in the config.

[source,cypher]
----
CALL algo.triangleCount('MATCH (p:Person) RETURN id(p) as id',
'MATCH (p1:Person)-[:KNOWS]->(p2:Person) RETURN id(p1) as source,id(p2) as target',

yield loadMillis, computeMillis, writeMillis, nodeCount, triangleCount, averageClusteringCoefficient
----
