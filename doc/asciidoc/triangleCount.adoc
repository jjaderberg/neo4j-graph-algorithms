= Community detection: Triangle Counting / Clustering Coefficient

// tag::introduction[]
Triangle counting is a community detection graph algorithm that is used to determine the number of triangles passing through each node in the graph.
A triangle is a set of three nodes where each node has a relationship to all other nodes.
// end::introduction[]

== History, Explanation

// tag::explanation[]

Triangle counting gained popularity in social network analysis where it is used to detect communities and measure the cohesiveness of those communities.
It is often used as part of the computation of network indices such as the clustering coefficient.

There are two types of clustering coefficient:

* The *local clustering coefficient* of a node is the likelihood that its neighbours are also connected. The computation of this score involves triangle counting.
* The *global clustering coefficient* is the normalized sum of those local clustering coefficients.

The transitivity coefficient of a graph, which is just three times the number of triangles divided by the number of triples in the graph is sometimes used.[2]

== When to use it / use-cases

// tag::use-case[]
Triangle counting has gained popularity in many other domains including:

* computer network security - intrusion detection and spamming
* web applications - community detection and blog analysis
* social network analysis - link prediction, spam filters, content quality control https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/110b/55a017f52abfedca220036ea129d84b7cadc.pdf[[5\]]

== Example Usage

In graph theory, a clustering coefficient is a measure of the degree to which nodes in a graph tend to cluster together.
Evidence suggests that in most real-world networks, and in particular social networks, nodes tend to create tightly knit groups characterised by a relatively high density of ties; this likelihood tends to be greater than the average probability of a tie randomly established between two nodes.[4] 

We check if this holds true for Yelp's social network of friends.

[source,cypher]
----
include::scripts/triangle-count.cypher[tag=triangle-write-yelp]
----

Average clustering coefficient is 0.0523, which is really low for a social network. 
This indicates that groups of friends are not tightly knit together, but rather sparse.
We can assume that users are not on Yelp for finding and creating friends, like for example Facebook, but rather something else, like finding good restaurant recommendations.

   
Local triangle count and clustering coefficient of nodes can be used as features in finding influencers in social networks.

== Cypher projection

If label and relationship-type are not selective enough to describe your subgraph to run the algorithm on, you can use Cypher statements to load or project subsets of your graph.
Can be also used to run algorithms on a virtual graph.
Set `graph:'cypher'` in the config.

== Details

_algo.triangle.stream(..)_ returns a Stream of Triples with nodeIds for each triangle.

_algo.triangleCount(..)_ counts the number of triangles a node is member of and writes it back.
It also counts the triangle in the whole graph and returns it in the Stats

_algo.triangleCount.stream(..)_ counts number of triangles a node is member of and returns
a stream with nodeId and triangleCount

*Note*


*sum(triangleCount) == triangleCount * 3* because every triangle adds 1 to each of its 3 nodes.
