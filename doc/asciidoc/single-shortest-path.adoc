= Single Source Shortest Path

// tag::introduction[]
The _Single Source Shortest Path_ algorithm calculates the shortest weight path between a pair of nodes.
A common algorithm used is Dijkstra.
// end::introduction[]

== History, Explanation

// tag::explanation[]
Path finding has a long history and is considered to be one of the classical graph problems.
It has been researched as far back as the 19th century.
Classical references are Wiener [1873], Lucas [1882] (describing a method due to C.P. Tr´emaux), and Tarry [1895] – see Biggs, Lloyd, and Wilson [1976].

Dijkstra thought about the shortest path problem when working as a programmer at the Mathematical Center in Amsterdam in 1956 to demonstrate the capabilities of the new ARMAC computer.
His wanted to choose both a problem and an answer (that would be produced by computer) that non-computing people could understand.
He designed what is now known as Dijkstra's algorithm and later implemented it on the ARMAC for a slightly simplified transportation map of 64 cities in the Netherlands.

It gained prominence in the early 1950s in the context of ‘alternate routing’
i.e. finding a second shortest route if the shortest route is blocked.
It found uses in urban planning http://onlinepubs.trb.org/Onlinepubs/hrbbulletin/61/61-003.pdf[[1]] as well as telephone call routing.

== When to use it / use-cases

// tag::use-case[]
The most common usage of the single source shortest path algorithm is finding directions between physical locations.
Web mapping websites such as MapQuest or Google Maps use it to provide driving directions.

It has also found uses in several other areas including:

* Telecommunications and networking
* Operations research - plant and facility layout, robotics, transportation, and VLSI design.
* Social networks - find the degrees of separation between people
* IP routing - find the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Shortest_Path_First[Open Shortest Path First^]

// end::use-case[]

== Constraints / when not to use it

// tag::constraint[]
Dijkstra does not support negative weights.
The algorithm assumes that adding a relationship to a path can never make a path shorter - an invariant that would be violated with negative weights.
// end::constraint[]

== Versions 

We support the following versions of the shortest path algorithms:

* [x] directed, unweighted:  

** direction: 'OUTGOING' or INCOMING, weightProperty: null

* [x] directed, weighted 

** direction: 'OUTGOING' or INCOMING, weightProperty: 'cost'

* [x] undirected, unweighted

** direction: 'BOTH', weightProperty: null

* [x] undirected, weighted 

** direction: 'BOTH', weightProperty: 'cost'

- Dijkstra single source shortest path algorithm
- there may be more then one shortest path, algo returns only one
- if initialized with an non-existing weight-property it will treat the graph as unweighted

- specify start node, find the shortest paths to all other nodes
- parallel non-negative single source shortest path algorithm for weighted graphs
- It can be tweaked using the delta-parameter which controls the grade of concurrency.

== Implementation Details

:leveloffset: +1
// copied from: https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-graph-algorithms/issues/80

A _Single Source Shortest Path_ algorithms calculates a path between a pair of nodes whose summed weights are minimal. A common algorithm used is Dijkstra. _All Pairs Shortest Path_ on the other hand calculates a shortest path forest containing all paths between the nodes in the graph. An algorithm to solve this is Floyd Warshall or Parallel Johnson's algorithm. 

## Progress

- [x] single threaded implementation
- [x] tests
- [x] simple benchmark 
- [x] implement procedure
- [ ] benchmark on bigger graphs
- [ ] parallelization
- [ ] evaluation

## Requirements

`(Outgoing)RelationshipIterator` & `Weights`

## Data structured involved

- An int-based Fibonacci Heap which implements an efficient priority queue. 
- Different Container for Costs / visited state / paths

## ToDo

### benchmark

Implement benchmark on big graph

### parallelization

Parallizing _All Pairs Shortest Path_ might be easy using Dijkstra on each thread for a different node. An easy approach for _Single Source SP_ may use two threads. One starting at the start-node, one at the end-node. The first wins. [More](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~vs3/comp422/lecture-notes/comp422-lec24-s08-v2.pdf)

### evaluation

- Performance tests on different dataset sizes / level of concurrency

== Details


=== algo.shortestPath

- Dijkstra single source shortest path algorithm
- The algorithm computes a shortest path on weighted graphs
 between a given start and target-NodeId. It returns result tuples of [nodeId, distance] of each node
 in the path
- there may be more then one shortest path, algo returns only one
- if initialized with an not-existing weight-property and a defaultWeight of 1.0 the resulting path is minimal in
 terms of count of nodes in the path.
 
 
=== algo.shortestPaths

- Dijkstra single source shortest path algorithm
- returns minimum distance to *all other nodes*
- if initialized with an not-existing weight-property and a defaultWeight of 1.0 the resulting path is minimal in terms of count of nodes in the path.


=== algo.shortestPath.deltaStepping

TODO naming!?
- parallel non-negative single source shortest path algorithm for weighted graphs
- It can be tweaked using the delta-parameter which controls the grade of concurrency.
- returns minimum distance to *all other nodes*
- if initialized with an non-existing weight-property and a defaultWeight of 1.0 its result can be interpreted as
 the number of nodes to reach the target
