= All Pairs- and Single Source - Shortest Path

A _Single Source Shortest Path_ algorithms calculates a path between a pair of nodes whose summed weights are minimal. A common algorithm used is Dijkstra. 

_All Pairs Shortest Path_ on the other hand calculates a shortest path forest containing all paths between the nodes in the graph. An algorithm to solve this is Floyd Warshall or Parallel Johnson's algorithm. 

== History, Explanation

Path finding, in particular searching in a maze, belongs to the classical graph problems, and the classical references are Wiener [1873], Lucas [1882] (describing a method due to C.P. Tr´emaux), and Tarry [1895] – see Biggs, Lloyd, and Wilson [1976]. 
They form the basis for depth-first search techniques.
Path problems were also studied at the beginning of the 1950’s in the context of ‘alternate routing’, that is, finding a second shortest route if the shortest route is blocked. 
This applies to freeway usage (Trueblood [1952]), but also to telephone call routing. 
At that time making long-distance calls in the U.S.A. was automatized, and alternate routes for telephone calls over the U.S. telephone network nation-wide should be found automatically.

Dijkstra thought about the shortest path problem when working at the Mathematical Center in Amsterdam in 1956 as a programmer to demonstrate capabilities of a new computer called ARMAC. 
His objective was to choose both a problem as well as an answer (that would be produced by computer) that non-computing people could understand. 
He designed the shortest path algorithm and later implemented it for ARMAC for a slightly simplified transportation map of 64 cities in the Netherlands. 


== When to use it / use-cases

Shortest path algorithms are applied to automatically find directions between physical locations, such as driving directions on web mapping websites like MapQuest or Google Maps. 

If one represents a nondeterministic abstract machine as a graph where nodes describe states and relationships describe possible transitions, shortest path algorithms can be used to find an optimal sequence of choices to reach a certain goal state, or to establish lower bounds on the time needed to reach a given state. 
For example, if nodes represent the states of a puzzle like a Rubik's Cube and each directed relationship corresponds to a single move or turn, shortest path algorithms can be used to find a solution that uses the minimum possible number of moves.

In a networking or telecommunications mindset, this shortest path problem is sometimes called the min-delay path problem and usually tied with a widest path problem. 
For example, the algorithm may seek the shortest (min-delay) widest path, or widest shortest (min-delay) path.

Other applications, often studied in operations research, include plant and facility layout, robotics, transportation, and VLSI design.

== Constraints / when not to use it

Dijkstra does not support negative weights as it relies on one simple fact: if all weights are non-negative, adding an edge can never make a path shorter. 
That's why picking the shortest candidate edge (local optimality) always ends up being correct (global optimality).
If that is not the case (we have negative weights), the frontier of candidate edges does not send the right signals; a cheap edge might lure you down a path with positive weights while an expensive one hides a path with negative weights.

For now only single-source shortest path support loading the relationship as undirected, but we can use cypher loading to help us solve this.
Undirected graph can be represented as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirected_graph[Bidirected graph], that is a directed graph in which the reverse of every relationship is also a relationship. 

We do not have to save this reversed relationship, we can project it using *cypher loading*.
Note that relationship query does not specify direction of the relationship. 
This is applicable to all other algorithms, that use *cypher loading*.

## Progress

- [x] single threaded implementation
- [x] tests
- [x] simple benchmark 
- [x] implement procedure
- [ ] benchmark on bigger graphs
- [ ] parallelization
- [ ] evaluation

## Requirements

`(Outgoing)RelationshipIterator` & `Weights`

## Data structured involved

- An int-based Fibonacci Heap which implements an efficient priority queue. 
- Different Container for Costs / visited state / paths

## ToDo

### benchmark

Implement benchmark on big graph

### parallelization

Parallizing _All Pairs Shortest Path_ might be easy using Dijkstra on each thread for a different node. An easy approach for _Single Source SP_ may use two threads. One starting at the start-node, one at the end-node. The first wins. [More](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~vs3/comp422/lecture-notes/comp422-lec24-s08-v2.pdf)

### evaluation

- Performance tests on different dataset sizes / level of concurrency


== Details


=== algo.shortestPath

- Dijkstra single source shortest path algorithm
- The algorithm computes a shortest path on weighted graphs
 between a given start and target-NodeId. It returns result tuples of [nodeId, distance] of each node
 in the path
- there may be more then one shortest path, algo returns only one
- if initialized with an not-existing weight-property and a defaultWeight of 1.0 the resulting path is minimal in
 terms of count of nodes in the path.
 
 
=== algo.shortestPaths

- Dijkstra single source shortest path algorithm
- returns minimum distance to *all other nodes*
- if initialized with an not-existing weight-property and a defaultWeight of 1.0 the resulting path is minimal in terms of count of nodes in the path.


=== algo.shortestPath.deltaStepping

TODO naming!?
- parallel non-negative single source shortest path algorithm for weighted graphs
- It can be tweaked using the delta-parameter which controls the grade of concurrency.
- returns minimum distance to *all other nodes*
- if initialized with an non-existing weight-property and a defaultWeight of 1.0 its result can be interpreted as
 the number of nodes to reach the target

=== algo.allShortestPaths.stream

- returns a stream of source-target node to distance tuples for each pair of nodes
- Since all nodeId's have already been ordered by the idMapping we can use an integer
 instead of a queue which just count's up for each startNodeId as long as it is
 < nodeCount.
- Each thread tries to take one int from the counter at one time and starts its computation on it.
- The {@link AllShortestPaths#concurrency} value determines the count of workers that should be spawned.
- Due to the high memory footprint the result set would have we emit each result into
 a blocking queue. The result stream takes elements from the queue while the workers
 add elements to it.
- The result stream is limited by N^2. If the stream gets closed prematurely the workers get closed too.
- writeback not supported!
