= Minimum Weight Spanning Tree

// tag::introduction[]
A _Minimum Weight Spanning Tree_ (MST) is a subgraph that contains all the nodes from the original graph and the set of relationships that connect the nodes together with the minimum possible weight.
Our current approach uses _Prim's Algorithm_ to calculate the MST starting at a given node.
The K-Means variant can be used to detect clusters in the graph.

== History, Explanation

// tag::explanation[]
In graph theory, a tree is a way of connecting all the nodes together, so that there is exactly one path from a node to any other node in the tree.
If the graph represents cities connected by roads, one could select a number of roads, so that each city can be reached from every other, but that there is no more than one way to travel from one city to another.

Most of the time, graphs are weighted; each connection between two cities has a weight: It might cost something to travel on a given road, or one connection may be longer than the other, this means it takes more time to travel on that connection. 

A graph might have more than one minimum spanning tree.
In a graph where all the relationships have the same weight, every tree is a minimum spanning tree.
If all the relationships have different weights there is exactly one minimal spanning tree.

Czech scientist Otakar Borůvka developed the first known algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree in 1926, while trying to find an efficient electricity network for Moravia.
This algorithm is known as Borůvka's algorithm.

Prim's algorithm (sometimes known as the Jarník-Prim algorithm) is one of the simplest and best-known minimum spanning tree algorithms. 
It is similar to Dijkstra's algorithm, but rather than minimizing the total length of a path ending at each relationship we minimize the length of each relationship individually.
Unlike Dijkstra's, Prim's can tolerate negative-weight relationships.
It is optimal for dense graphs.

The algorithm operates as follows:

* start with a trivial tree containing only one node (and no relationship). It does not matter which node is chosen.
* select the minimal-weight relationship coming from that node and add it to our tree.
* repeatedly choose a minimal-weight relationship that joins any node in the tree to one not in the tree, adding the new relationship and node to our tree. Such a relationship will always exist when the tree is incomplete because otherwise the partially built tree would be an isolated component but we know the graph consists of a single connected component.
* when there are no more nodes to add, the tree we have built is a minimum spanning tree.

== When to use it / use-cases

// tag::use-case[]
Imagine a telecommunications company is trying to lay out cables in new neighborhood.
If the company is only able to lay the cable along certain paths (e.g. along roads), we could derive a graph that represents the points connected by those paths.
Some of those paths might be more expensive, because they are longer, or require the cable to be buried deeper; these paths would be represented by relationships with larger weights.
A spanning tree for that graph would be a subset of those paths that has no cycles but still connects to every house; in fact several spanning trees might be possible.
A minimum spanning tree would be the one with the lowest total cost, which would represent the least expensive path for laying the cable.

There are also some indirect applications such as LDPC codes for error correction, image registration with Renyi entropy, learning salient features for real-time face verification, model locality of particle interactions in turbulent fluid flows and autoconfig protocol for Ethernet bridging to avoid cycles in a network.
// end::use-case[]

== Constraints / when not to use it

// tag::constraint[]
The MST algorithm only gives meaningful results when run on a graph where the relationships have different weights.
If the graph has no weights or all relationships have the same weight then any spanning tree is a minimum spanning tree.
// end::constraint[]

Maximum weighted tree spanning algorithm is similar to the mininum one, except that it returns a spanning tree of all nodes in the component where the total weight of the relationships is maximized.

=== k-Spanning tree

Sometimes we want to limit the size of our spanning tree result as we are only interested in finding a smaller tree within our graph that does not span across all nodes. 
K-Spanning tree algorithm returns a tree with k nodes and k − 1 relationships.

In our sample graph we have 5 nodes.
When we ran MST above we got returned a 5-minimum spanning tree, that covered all five nodes.
By setting the `k=3` we define that we want to get returned a 3-minimum spanning tree that covers 3 nodes and has 2 relationships.

A _Minimum Weight Spanning Tree_ is a acyclic undirected graph which consists of all connected nodes and whose relationship weights are minimal. It can be used to cluster the graph (KMeans). Our current approach uses _Prim's Algorithm_ to calculate the MST starting at a given node. This might not cover the whole graph. But if the nodes are connected the MST is always identical regardless at which node the execution starts.
