= Community detection: Connected Components

// tag::introduction[]
_Connected Components_ or _UnionFind_ basically finds sets of connected nodes where each node is reachable from any other node in the same set. 
In graph theory, a connected component of an undirected graph is a subgraph in which any two vertices are connected to each other by paths, and which is connected to no additional vertices in the graph.
// end::introduction[]

== History, Explanation

// tag::explanation[]
The _Connected Components_ of a graph represent, in general terms, the pieces of the graph. 
Two vertices are in the same component of graph if and only if there is some path between them.

Finding connected components is at the heart of many graph applications. 
For example, consider the problem of identifying partitions in a set of items. 
We can represent each item by a node and add an edge between each pair of items that are deemed similar. 
The connected components of this graph correspond to different classes of items.
// end::explanation[]

== When to use it / use-cases

// tag::use-case[]
Testing whether a graph is connected is an essential preprocessing step for every graph algorithm. 
Such tests can be performed so quickly and easily that you should always verify that your input graph is connected, even when you know it has to be. 
Subtle, difficult-to-detect bugs often result when your algorithm is run only on one component of a disconnected graph.

Connected components have other practical use cases, for example, if we are analysing a social network and we want to find all the disconnected groups of people that exist in our graph.

== Algorithm explanation on simple sample graph

Recall that an undirected graph is connected if for every pair of vertices, there is a path in the graph between those vertices. 
A connected component of an undirected graph is a maximal connected subgraph of the graph. 
That means that the direction of the relationships in our graph have no influence as we treat our graph as undirected. 
We have two implementations of connected components algorithm. 
First implementations treats the graph as unweighted and the second version is weighted, where you can define the threshold of the weight above which relationships are created.

Results show us, that we have two distinct group of users that have no link between them. First group has members Alice,Charles,Bridget and the second group are Michael,Doug,Mark.

=== Weighted version:

If you define the property that holds the weight(weightProperty) and the threshold,it means the nodes are only connected, if the threshold on the weight of the relationship is high enough otherwise the relationship is thrown away.

We can observe, that because the weight of the relationship betwen Bridget and Alice is only 0.5, the relationship was thrown away and regarded as not existing. 

== Example Usage

As said Connected Components are an essential step in preprocessing your data. 
One reason is that most centralities suffer from disconnected components or you just want to find disconnected groups of nodes. 
Yelp's social network will be used to demonstrate how to proceed when dealing with real world data.
A typical social network consist of one big component and a number of small disconnected components.

.Get the count of connected components
[source,cypher]
----
include::scripts/connected-components.cypher[tag=count-component-yelp]
----

We get back count of disconnected components being 18512 if we do not count users without friends. 
Let's now check the size of top 20 components to get a better picture

.Get the size of top 20 components
[source,cypher]
----
include::scripts/connected-components.cypher[tag=top-20-component-yelp]
----

The biggest component has 8938630 out of total 8981389 (99,5%).
It is quite high, but not shocking as we have a friendship social network, where we can expect small world effect and 6 degree of separation rule, where you can get to any person in a social network, just depends how long is the path.

We can now move on to next step of analysis and run centralities only on the biggest components, so that our results will be more accurate.
We just simply write back the results to the node, and use centralities with cypher loading or set a new label for the biggest component.

== Cypher projection

If label and relationship-type are not selective enough to describe your subgraph to run the algorithm on, you can use Cypher statements to load or project subsets of your graph.
Can be also used to run algorithms on a virtual graph.
Set `graph:'cypher'` in the config.

== Implementations

`algo.unionFind`

- if a threshold configuration parameter is supplied only relationships with a property value higher then the threshold
are merged

`algo.unionFind.queue`

- parallel UnionFind using ExecutorService only.
- Algorithm based on the idea that DisjointSetStruct can be built using just a partition of the nodes
which are then merged pairwise.
- The implementation is based on a queue which acts as a buffer for each computed DSS. As long as there are
more elements on the queue the algorithm takes two, merges them and adds its result to the queue until only
1 element remains.

`algo.unionFind.forkJoinMerge`

-  Like in *exp1* the resulting DSS of each node-partition is merged by the ForkJoin pool while
the calculation of the DSS is done by the ExecutorService.

`algo.unionFind.forkJoin`

- calculation and merge using forkJoinPool

`algo.unionFind.mscoloring`

- coloring based parallel algorithm

== Implementation Details

// copied from: https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-graph-algorithms/issues/79

_Connected Components_ or _UnionFind_ basically finds sets of connected nodes where each node is reachable from any other node in the same set. One implementation also evaluates a Predicate on each relation which allows partitioning of the graph based on Relationships and Properties.

## Progress

- [x] single threaded implementation
- [x] tests
- [x] simple benchmark 
- [x] implement procedure
- [x] benchmark on bigger graphs
- [x] parallelization
- [x] evaluation

## Requirements

`AllRelationshipIterator` & `Weights`

## Data structured involved

We use a disjoint-set-structure which is based on a parent-array-tree. The DSS can be used to efficiently ask if two nodes are reachable by each other. [More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure)

## ToDo

### benchmark

Implement benchmark on big graph & 

- stream nodeId-setId pairs
- calculate setSize-setCount


### parallelization

One approach to parallelize _UnionFind_ might be _relationship partitioning_ where each thread performs the execution into it's own DSS instance on a subset of relationships. So each thread calculates a distinct set of unions. Later we can merge each DSS pairwise which can also be perfomed in parallel. Nonetheless the memory consumption might be high due to the preallocated array in DSS. We could also switch to a growing container if this is a problem.

### evaluation

- Performance tests on different dataset sizes / level of concurrency

- writes a cluster-id to each node representing the a connected component where each node
is reachable from any other node
