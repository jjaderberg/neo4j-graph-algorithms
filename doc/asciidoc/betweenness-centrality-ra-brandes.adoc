= Approximation of betweenness centrality

// tag::introduction[]
The fastest known algorithm for exactly computing betweenness of all the nodes, designed by Brandes, requires at least `O(nm)` time for unweighted graphs, where `n` is the number of nodes and `m` is the number of relationships.
For large-scale graphs exact centrality computation isn't practical [2], but we can work with a subset of the nodes and calculate an approximate score.

== RA-Brandes Algorithm

// tag::explanation[]
RA-Brandes algorithm, proposed by Brandes and Pich[3], is different from original Brandes’ algorithm in only one main respect:
Brandes’ algorithm considers all nodes within the graph, whereas RA-Brandes considers only a subset of nodes, also known as pivots, from the graph.

We implement two strategies of selecting the subset of nodes:

* random: nodes are selected uniformly at random with defined probability of selection. Default probability is `log10(N) / e^2`. If probability is 1 then the algorithm works as original Brandes where all nodes are loaded.

* degree: first calculates the mean degree of the nodes and then only visits nodes whose degree is higher then the mean. i.e. only dense nodes are visited

First step in calculating betweenness centrality is to collect all shortest paths that run through specific node. With parameter `maxDepth` you can limit the depth of all shortest paths traversal.
